PHP + HTML edits


ISSUES
- possible that extra whitespace between user role or user first and last name can cause a login error 
	(test and fix - might have to manually implement strip) (probably ignore this issue tbh)
- System flaw, deleting a medicalpersonnel could leave an orphaned patient note (patient will ref a personnel id that does not exist idgaf about atm, but had to note it for memory if we decide to run this project further)
- concurrent editing for notes implemented but not tested
- reloading the page after adding a note can make a addition of a duplicate note
